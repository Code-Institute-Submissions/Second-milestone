### Bug encountered
I have tried to rename the `onClick=myFunction()` with a more explainary name, but it only throw the error of undefined in the console, but work no problem with `myFunction()`. So i ledt the way it is.

In my `map.js` i have encountered a bug that if i leave my `[]` empty when defining or iterating it would throw an error in VScode. `Uncaught syntax error unexpected token ']'` and in the Google developer.
